# amazon-system-simulator

amazon-system-simulator was a Java project for CPS 209: Computer Science II that was based around a simulation of an e-commerce system like Amazon. A skeleton code was provided and the main goal of the project was to write code to make commands work.


  
  In order to use the project, type in the following commands while being in the project directory:
  > javac ECommerceUserInterface.java
  
  > java ECommerceUserInterface
  
  From there, you can type in commands that are featured in the ECommerceUserInterface.java file.
  The commands that I have implemented are:
  - CUSTS
  - BOOKS
  - ORDERS
  - SHIPPED
  - ORDER
  - SHIP
  - CUSTORDERS
  - NEWCUST
  - CANCEL
  - ORDERBOOK
  - SORTBYPRICE
  - SORTBYNAME
  - SORTCUSTS
